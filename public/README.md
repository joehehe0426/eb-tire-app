# Public Folder

This folder contains static assets that are copied to the `dist` folder during build.

## Logo File

Please ensure `logo.png` is in this `public/` folder (not in root).

If `logo.png` is currently in the root directory, move it here:
```bash
mv logo.png public/logo.png
```

Vite will automatically copy files from `public/` to `dist/` during build.
